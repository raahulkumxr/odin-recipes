        <h2> Desciption </h2>
        <p> This classic Veg Fried Rice recipe is made with a hearty mix of fresh vegetables, green onions, seasonings and spices for an incredibly flavorful fried rice dish. Hands-down this is one of our favorite Chinese-inspired recipes. Not only is Vegetable Fried Rice amazingly easy to make from scratch, it’s a naturally vegan dish that’s as good for you as it is delicious to eat. You can even tweak veg fried rice to be gluten-free simply by omitting soy sauce or using tamari. And although Chinese fried rice is a healthy option, it is loaded with lots of exciting flavors. Salty, umami, and savory soy sauce is balanced with spiced star anise, and raw scallions add a great pop of freshness you’ll love. Otherwise, I’ve kept the ingredients list rather basic to allow each element to shine – the veggies really are the star here!</p>

            <li> 1 tablespoon soy sauce (naturally brewed) or tamari – can add less or more as required or completely skip </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon rice wine or rice vinegar </li>
            <li> ½ teaspoon black pepper powder or add as required </li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons spring onions greens – chopped (scallion greens) </li>
            <li> salt as required </li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Steps </h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Heat oil in a wok or a pan. First add the star anise and fry for a few seconds or until the oil becomes fragrant.</li>
            <li> Add the garlic, ginger and sauté for some seconds. No need to brown the garlic.</li>
            <li> Add the spring onions whites and sauté for about 2 minutes. </li>   
            <li> Then add finely chopped french beans. </li>
            <li> Stir fry french beans for 2 to 3 minutes over medium to medium-high heat. </li>
            <li> Add the remaining finely chopped veggies, including mushrooms and celery. Increase the heat to a high to thoroughly cook all of the vegetables.</li>
            <li> You have to continuously toss and stir while frying so that the veggies are uniformly cooked and do not get burnt. </li>
            <li> The vegetables have to be stir-fried, until they are almost cooked and yet retain their crunchiness and crispiness. Stir-frying vegetables on high heat takes about 4 to 6 minutes. </li>
            <li> Add the soy sauce, salt and pepper. Stir quickly and add cooked and cooled rice. </li>
            <li> Stir fry for a few minutes until the sauce has coated the rice well. Keep a check when adding salt, as soy sauce already has salt in it. </li>
            <li> Serve the veg fried rice hot as it is or with with your favorite Chinese side. </li>
